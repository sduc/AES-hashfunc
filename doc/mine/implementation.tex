\section{Implementation}
In this section we present an implementation of hash function using the three parallel call block cipher based compression function.
The implementation uses a four-core Intel Westmere CPU and makes use of the AES instruction set~\cite{intel-aes}.
Finally we use cycles per bytes to benchmark our implementation and we compare it with the other implementation that used only two parallel call of a block cipher.
The measure are done as described in~\cite{efficient-hash}.
\subsection{Overview}
To implement the hash function by making use of the block cipher based compression function we apply the Merkle-Damg\aa rd construction.

\subsection{Parallelization}
Let us describe more in detailed how we parallelized the hash function over a four-core CPU.
\subsection{Benchmarking}
